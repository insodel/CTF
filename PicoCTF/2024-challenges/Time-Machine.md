## Description
What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember... You can download the challenge files here:
*challenge.zip*

### Content of the .zip
1. A .txt file named 'message'
2. A folder named .git (standard naming for Github repositories))

### Solving
Opening message.txt we obtain the following text:
``` This is what I was working on, but I'd need to look at my commit history to know why... ```
Pretty straightforward. 
We can find the commit history in .git > logs > refs > heads > master
In there, the flag in plain text.
